## About Me:

I am **ZhechongHuang(黄柘铳)**, an undergraduate student at PKU, doing reasearch about program synthesis under the guidance of [Prof. Xiong](https://xiongyingfei.github.io). 

I'm interested in programming language theory, especially in program verification and program synthesis, and love to explore new technologies and keep on developing new projects.
